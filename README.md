# UseR Meetup slides

Slides and associated code for my 2018-04 presentation at the Pittsburgh useR Meetup.

## Compilation

Execute `code.R` to generate data and plots used by the presentation. It will take just over an hour to run
the first time due to the lengthly hyperparameter tunign step. This gets cached for successive runs.

Finally, use something like Rstudio to knit the .Rmd file to produce the slides.
